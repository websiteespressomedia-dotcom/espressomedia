  "content-strategy-and-marketing": [
    {
      q: "How many social media posts do I need per month to see real growth?",
      a: "Consistency beats volume. On Instagram, 3-6 posts per week (12-24 per month) plus daily Stories delivers better results than posting 7 times in one week and then going silent."
    },
    {
      q: "Which social media platform is best for business in 2026?",
      a: "The right platform depends on your audience, buying behaviour, and business model. Instagram and YouTube are often strong channels for consumer-focused brands, while Facebook remains effective for broader demographics and lead generation. LinkedIn is typically the strongest platform for B2B and professional services, and WhatsApp can be highly effective for nurturing and re-engaging existing audiences. At The Espresso Media, we focus on identifying the highest-leverage channels first—mastering 1–2 platforms before expanding strategically."
    },
    {
      q: "How does The Espresso Media create a month’s worth of content in a single day?",
      a: "Our team specialises in structured batch content production designed to maximise output without compromising quality. Every content day is planned in advance from strategy and scripting to shot planning and production flow allowing us to efficiently capture and organise a month’s worth of content in a single shoot day.\n\nFor brands that prefer not to film, we create content using AI-assisted visuals, stock assets, motion design, and creative editing techniques to maintain consistent output without requiring on-camera production. This allows brands to stay visible with high-quality content while reducing time investment and operational complexity."
    },
    {
      q: "What is a realistic budget to start running Meta or Google Ads?",
      a: "For Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram), a minimum effective test budget is Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 per month for lead generation campaigns targeting a single city. Below this, the algorithm does not have enough data to optimize. For e-commerce or national campaigns, Rs 25,000-Rs 50,000 per month is the entry point for meaningful results. Google Search Ads for high-intent keywords in competitive industries (real estate, healthcare, education) require Rs 20,000-Rs 50,000 per month minimum. Our management fee is separate from your ad spend."
    },
    {
      q: "What does 5.2x ROAS mean and is that achievable for my business?",
      a: "ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) of 5.2x means for every Rs 1 spent on ads, you generate Rs 5.20 in revenue, a 420% return. This is our average across all managed accounts. Your ROAS will depend on your product/service margins, audience size, ad creative quality, and landing page conversion rate. E-commerce brands typically see 4-8x ROAS with well-optimised campaigns. Lead generation businesses (real estate, education, healthcare) measure success by Cost Per Lead (CPL) rather than ROAS."
    },
    {
      q: "How long before I see results from my ad campaigns?",
      a: "Meta Ads have a learning phase of 7-14 days per ad set during which performance is volatile. Plan for the first month to be a data-collection period: we will identify your best-performing creatives, audiences, and offers. Month 2 is when we scale what works and dramatically improve CPL."
    }
  ],
  "branding-and-creative-solutions": [
    {
      q: "How many logo concepts do I receive and how many revisions are included?",
      a: "Each brand identity project includes 2–3 strategically developed creative directions built around your positioning, audience, and approved brief. Once a direction is selected, two structured revision rounds are included to refine and finalise the identity system while keeping the process focused and intentional. Additional revision rounds are available as an optional add-on at an additional cost.\n\nFinal delivery goes beyond the logo itself and includes a complete identity package with all required brand assets and usage files. This includes logo formats for digital and print (SVG, PNG, JPG, PDF), colour variations, and a brand guidelines document covering visual application, clear space, minimum sizing, typography, and colour specifications."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the turnaround time for ad creatives?",
      a: "We operate with a structured production workflow designed to balance speed with quality. Retainer projects are typically delivered within 5–7 business days from approved brief to final assets, with priority support available for high-urgency campaigns."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you create a full brand identity if I am starting a new business?",
      a: "Yes, building complete brand identities for new businesses is one of our core offerings. We create strategic identity systems that establish how your brand looks, communicates, and appears across every platform from day one.\n\nOur Branding Kit includes logo design, visual identity development, typography, supporting brand assets, and detailed brand guidelines—giving you a complete foundation to launch consistently and scale confidently."
    }
  ],
  "commercial-production": [
    {
      q: "Do you handle the entire production process?",
      a: "Yes. We manage the complete process from creative direction, concept development, scripting, production planning, shoot execution, editing, and final delivery ensuring a streamlined experience from start to finish."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does a commercial production project take?",
      a: "Timelines vary depending on production scale, locations, and deliverables. Smaller productions can move quickly, while larger campaigns require additional planning, shooting, and post-production time."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you create content for ads and social media from the same shoot?",
      a: "Absolutely. We structure productions to maximise output, allowing one shoot to generate assets across advertising, social media, website use, and ongoing content requirements."
    },
    {
      q: "How does The Espresso Media create a month’s worth of content in a single day?",
      a: "Our team specialises in structured batch content production designed to maximise output without compromising quality. Every content day is planned in advance from strategy and scripting to shot planning and production flow allowing us to efficiently capture and organise a month’s worth of content in a single shoot day.\n\nFor brands that prefer not to film, we create content using AI-assisted visuals, stock assets, motion design, and creative editing techniques to maintain consistent output without requiring on-camera production.

    }
  ],
  "web-development": [
    {
      q: "How long does it take to build a website?",
      a: "Website timelines depend on scope, functionality, and content readiness. Standard business websites are typically completed within 2–3 weeks from approved brief and project confirmation. E-commerce websites and more advanced builds require additional planning and development time.\n\nEvery website follows our structured delivery process: discovery and planning, wireframes and design, development, testing and optimisation, followed by launch and handover—ensuring quality and performance at every stage."
    },
    {
      q: "Will my website be optimized for SEO from the start?",
      a: "Yes, SEO fundamentals are built into every website from day one. We structure websites with search performance in mind, including technical setup, content hierarchy, metadata, sitemap configuration, analytics integration, structured data, image optimisation, and performance improvements to support discoverability and long-term growth.\n\nOur goal is to launch websites that are not only visually strong but technically prepared to perform."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens after my website launches? Do you offer maintenance?",
      a: "Yes. Every website includes an initial post-launch support period to cover adjustments, fixes, and final refinements after going live. We also offer ongoing maintenance plans that include updates, backups, monitoring, security management, and routine content support to keep your website running smoothly as your business grows.\n\nFor clients who prefer a hands-off experience, our team can continue managing the website after launch through a dedicated support plan."
    }
  ],
  "ai-automation": [
    {
      q: "Will the AI chatbot sound like a real person?",
      a: "Yes. We configure every chatbot to match your brand voice — so every conversation feels natural, helpful, and on brand. Your audience won't feel like they're talking to a machine."
    },
    {
      q: "How quickly can the automation be set up?",
      a: "Most WhatsApp automation systems and chatbots are up and running within 7 to 10 business days. The timeline depends on the complexity of your flows and the number of integrations required — we'll give you a clear timeline before we begin."
    },
    {
      q: "What kind of businesses is this suited for?",
      a: "Any business that receives leads, enquiries, or customer messages. Whether you're a retail brand, a service business, a clinic, or a real estate company — if you're getting messages and losing leads to slow response times, this system is built for you."
    },
    {
      q: "Can the chatbot book appointments directly?",
      a: "Yes. We configure your chatbot to handle the full booking flow — from availability checking to confirmation — so your calendar fills itself without any manual back and forth."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens when a lead needs a human?",
      a: "The chatbot is smart enough to know its limits. When a conversation needs a personal touch, it hands off to your team instantly — with the full conversation history so nothing gets repeated or missed."
